:dart: Assignment Week 2
---
You are diving into the open source ecosystem and will take a closer look at some open source communities. This week is about understanding how open source communities organize, who is involved, and where to find this kind of information.

**Goal**: Describe your community governance and identify key players.

Four communities to look at:

- FreeBSD
- Node.js
- two more communities from your week 1 list


**Task**: As a team and for each of your open source communities, look at the governance documents, observe key members in these communities, identify the artifacts the communities are working on, and familiarize yourself with the community.


**Deliverable**: A markdown document for each community describing its mission, its governance, key members, artifacts, and other noteworthy characteristics.

## FreeBSD

### Mission
---

**What is the FreeBSD Foundation?**

The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3), US based, non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide. Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and is used to fund and manage projects, fund conferences and developer summits, and provide travel grants to FreeBSD developers.

The Foundation purchases hardware to improve and maintain FreeBSD infrastructure, and funds staffing to improve test coverage, continuous integration and automation.

The Foundation advocates for FreeBSD by promoting FreeBSD at technical conferences and events around the world. The Foundation also provides workshops, educational material, and presentations to recruit more users and contributors to FreeBSD.

The Foundation also represents the FreeBSD Project in executing contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require a recognized legal entity.

**What can I expect from the FreeBSD Foundation?**

The FreeBSD Foundation supports both the development and popularization of FreeBSD, the world’s best open source operating system. We do this in a number of ways including:

Operating System Improvements: Providing staff to immediately respond to urgent problems and implement new features and functionality allowing for the innovation and stability you’ve come to rely on.

Security: Providing engineering resources to bolster the capacity and responsiveness of the Security team providing you with peace of mind when security issues arise.

Quality Assurance: Improving and increasing test coverage, continuous integration, and automated testing with a full-time software engineer to ensure you receive the highest quality, secure, and reliable operating system.

New User Experience: Improving the process and documentation for getting new people involved with FreeBSD, and supporting those people as they become integrated into the FreeBSD Community.

Training: Supporting more FreeBSD training for undergraduates, graduates, and postgraduates. Growing the community means reaching people and catching their interest in systems software as early as possible. More training provides job seekers an additional set of in-demand skills and employers a bigger pool of skilled candidates.

Face-to-Face Opportunities: Facilitating collaboration among members of the community, and building connections throughout the industry to support a healthy and growing ecosystem and make it easier for you to find resources when questions emerge.

### Artifacts
---

### Noteworthy characteristics

A FreeBSD Project Member is an individual who has made a notable contribution to the FreeBSD Project, and who is continuing to contribute to the Project. That may be in the form of new code, documentation, or patches to existing code and documentation, or in other ways that the Core Team designates, including community management and advocacy.
In other words people that build the brand and contribute are selected to be more visible positions.

## Node.JS

### Mission

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

### Governance

The Node.js project follows a Consensus Seeking decision making model.
The nodejs/node core GitHub repository is maintained by the Collaborators who are added by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the TSC and their nomination is discussed with the existing Collaborators.

The project is governed jointly by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project, and the Community Committee (CommComm) which is responsible for guiding and extending the Node.js community.
